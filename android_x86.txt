Start VM with NAT networking
Alt + F1 to get console

to get ip address

open terminal in host
run

should see
$ adb connect 192.168.181.132
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
connected to 192.168.181.132:5555

Should now be able to use sbt to deploy to vm
sbt> reinstall-emulator
